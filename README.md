This respoitory contains the sources for [a workshop I hosted on GitHub Pages](http://aftleuven.be/event/web-development-online-cv/) for [AFT Leuven](http://aftleuven.be) and the [PHP Leuven Meetup Web Innovation Group](http://meetup.com/PHP-Leuven-Web-Innovation-Group).

The resulting site can be browsed via https://christophevg.github.io.

Every step presented in the slides is applied to this repository, and can be relived going through [each of the commits to this repository](https://github.com/christophevg/christophevg.github.io/commits/master).
