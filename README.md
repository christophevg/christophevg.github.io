This respoitory contains the sources for [a workshop I hosted on GitHub Pages](http://aftleuven.be/event/web-development-online-cv/) for [AFT Leuven](http://aftleuven.be) and the [PHP Leuven Meetup Web Innovation Group](http://meetup.com/PHP-Leuven-Web-Innovation-Group).

The resulting site can be browsed via https://christophevg.github.io.

Slides for this workshop can be found at http://www.slideshare.net/christophevg/git-hub-pages-69001172. The screen capture movies that were part of the slides during the workshop are also available on the [Movies page in this repository's wiki](https://github.com/christophevg/christophevg.github.io/wiki/Movies).

Every step presented in the slides is applied to this repository, and can be relived going through [each of the commits to this repository](https://github.com/christophevg/christophevg.github.io/commits/master).
